Bourbon burger and sauce recipe
Serves 3-4

Ingredients:
For the bourbon burgers

1 pound 85 percent lean ground beef
2 teaspoons bourbon
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
3 slices cheddar cheese
3 slices baked bacon, cut in half
1/2 sweet onion, sliced into rings
1 tablespoon butter
3-4 buns
1 large tomato, sliced
4 large lettuce leaves
For the bourbon sauce

3 tablespoons bourbon
1/4 cup unsalted butter
1/2 cup sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon ketchup
Directions:
Preheat your grill to 400 degrees F.
In a large bowl, combine the meat, bourbon, garlic powder, salt and Worcestershire sauce. Mix using your hands. Form 3 to 4 large patties, and indent the centers using your thumb.
Place the patties on a well-oiled grilled, and cook for 15 minutes or until done.
In a large saut√© pan over medium heat, melt the butter. Stir in the onions, and cook until tender. While the onions and the patties are cooking, get the ingredients for the bourbon sauce ready.
To a small pot over low-medium heat, add all the ingredients for the bourbon sauce. Cook for 8 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, and then remove from heat.
To make the burgers, layer the bottom bun with lettuce, tomato, patty, cheese, onions, bacon, bourbon sauce and then the top of the bun.
